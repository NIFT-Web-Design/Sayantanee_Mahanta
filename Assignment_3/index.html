      <h2>Aesthetic of Mangalagiri Saree</h2>
      <p>Every handloom makes for an heirloom piece that speaks volume about our countryâ€™s culture and traditions. The uniqueness of a Mangalgiri weave is its minimalistic motifs, tribal embellishments, temple designs, a plain body with an intricate
        border and detailed zari work. Another discrete feature is that the fabric is woven only pit looms, as it
        helps in exerting maximum force and results in a tightly knit weave.</p>
        <p>Mangalagiri saree are a piece of glory, woven from cotton having the most characteristic features. As the town is also the house of Lord Narasimha swamy, the saris are also
        used by the devotees for devotional purposes</p>
