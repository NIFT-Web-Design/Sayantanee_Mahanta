      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Mangalagiri Sarees and Fabrics are produced by performing Handicraft weaving in Mangalagiri, a town in Guntur District of Andhra Pradesh. It is one of many traditional Indian Handlooms.The Mangalagiri fabric is produced by weaving with the
        help of pitlooms from
        combed yarn by warp and woof interlacing. The fabric then undergoes the process of dying. Some of the most commonly found patterns and motifs include the nizam pattern and
        floral motifs, the modern day weavers also entertain special orders with custom designs.</p>

      <h2>Aesthetic of Mangalagiri Saree</h2>
      <p>Every handloom makes for an heirloom piece that speaks volume about our country’s culture and traditions. The uniqueness of a Mangalgiri weave is its minimalistic motifs, tribal embellishments, temple designs, a plain body with an intricate
        border and detailed zari work. Another discrete feature is that the fabric is woven only pit looms, as it
        helps in exerting maximum force and results in a tightly knit weave.</p>
      <p>Mangalagiri saree are a piece of glory, woven from cotton having the most characteristic features. As the town is also the house of Lord Narasimha swamy, the saris are also
        used by the devotees for devotional purposes</p>
