  <h2>Flexibility with Timing, Budget, and Location</h2>
  <p>We have a number of consultants available on a full-time basis, however, we know that full-time consultants aren’t always the right choice for an organization’s project or budget. That’s why we always strive to be flexible and accommodating. Below are a few of the ways that we can meet your specific needs.</p>
  <article>
    <h3>part-time consultants</h3>
    <p>Not all positions need to be full-time. You may find that you need someone with a highly specific skill set to work on a project only part-time. We can always find the right consultants to fit your specific requirements.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h3>advice on retainer</h3>
    <p>At times you just need a little impartial advice here and there, without the investment in a full-time consultant. We can put you in contact with the right person to answer your questions on an as-needed basis.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h3>remote consultants</h3>
    <p>When you need the job done right but don’t require a person in the office, we can find the right consultant at a lower cost if they work remotely.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h3>short-term contracts</h3>
    <p>Not every placement needs to be a 2 year contract. We recognize that many projects will require short-term work, and we are more than willing to collaborate with you to ensure the most flexible arrangement to fit your institution’s specific needs.</p>
  </article>
  <article class="">
    <h3>cost-flexible solutions</h3>
    <p>Whether you’d like to commit to an hourly contract or fixed-fee pricing, we offer a variety of options that allow you to meet your budget requirements. For example, in some cases, a junior consultant may be exactly what you need.</p>
  </article>
  <article class="">
    <h3>custom project solutions</h3>
    <p>If you don’t see one solution that works for you, we are more than happy to work to fit your needs and create a fair arrangement that works for you—whether that means modifying an existing service, combining services, or having a consultant work on a trial-basis.</p>
  </article>

  <h2>A Wide Variety of Specializations</h2>
  <p>Our goal is to handle any project in the most effective way possible, and that means having a variety of specialists available. Here are just a few examples:</p>
<article class="">
  <h3>strategists and advisors</h3>
  <p>A successful project requires a sturdy foundation upon which everything else is built. We can provide talented Higher Ed administration and IT strategists with the experience to systematically improve your strategy, operations, and technology to provide the best value and experience for your stakeholders.</p>
</article>
<article class="">
  <h3>functional consultants</h3>
  <p>Not every project requires every type of consulting, but most require some form of requirements gathering and analysis. From business analysts to project managers, we are sure we have the right fit for any functional IT consultant position.</p>
</article>
<article class="">
  <h3>technical consultants</h3>
  <p>When a project requires technical consultants who exceed expectations, we have you covered. From server administrators to network engineers and developers, we have the right fit for your specific needs, no matter how niche those requirements may be.</p>
